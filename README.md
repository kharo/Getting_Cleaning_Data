Getting_Cleaning_Data
=====================

Course Project

This repo is for the Course course Getting and Cleaning Data offered by John Hopkins Univ.  The repo provides access to a R script called run_analysis.R for peer review in the course.  There is also a codebook.md file that explains how the script works and more details on what the script does.

The provided script run_analysis.R is all the user needs to reproduce the data for this project/assignment.  Data can be downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.  Once these data are stored in the same working directory of the user's computer (not in any subfolders below the placement of the run_analysis.R file), the R file can be activated via "source on save" button in R studio (or sourced manually using the source() function) to reproduce the Tidy_Data.txt output file.

*all raw data must be taken out of subfolders and placed into same working directory as the R script.
